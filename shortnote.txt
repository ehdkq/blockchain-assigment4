I didn't really have any problems, as the code worked relatively well.
It took me a few to figure out the correct items to put into the empty fields.
One of the challenges was trying to correctly handle hte large numbers for the token amounts, and it not lead to precision errors.
Viem's parseunits and formatunits helped in that field. It convered the readable format in the UI that was required by the smart contract.

I also had to make sure it was saved locally as well, like the token address and team.
The DApp also automatically watches for the transfer events involving the account and refreshes the account whenever I sent or recieved tokens.
It also provides the colored statuses depending on if it was successful, not successful, or an error.
